## Features

- **Easily add video thumbnails with a play button overlay to an email template**<br>
  Simply type in the destination URL. If the video is hosted on Youtube/Dailymotion we get your thumbnail from the service. If the video is hosted elsewhere customize the thumbnail by adding your own image.

- **Track video clicks with Pardot Custom Redirects**<br>
  Leverage the full power of Pardot custom redirects by selecting a Custom Redirect as the destination from your connected Pardot Org.

- **Customize the video play button**<br>
  Customize the play button to match your thubmbnail background

- **Tested on multiple email clients**<br>
  The play button is rendered on most modern email clients. For legacy clients like outlook, we fallback to an image.
